multiCrack
==========

multiCrack is a python script that can crack hashes that use different hashing algorithms.
The algorithms include:
MD5
SHA-1
SHA-224
SHA-256
SHA-384
SHA-512


Limitations / TODO
==================
Does not factor if a hash is salter or not. (TODO)
The password file must be formatted as 'username: hash' (not including the single quotes) with each occuring on a new line

Example
python multiCrack.py

I've included a sample dictionary file and sample passwords file.
